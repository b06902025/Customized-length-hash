in randomness test, has result 29793722/118711 = 250.9 ~ 256 
the greatest problem is pseudo random without specific meaningness pull back the efficiency.
and if root-key is known, it is possible to generate several data that will collide in hash value is absolute zero. <-- can be solve by addkey in some way.
